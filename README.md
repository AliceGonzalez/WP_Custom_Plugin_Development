Welcome to the repository for the Custom
 WordPress Plugin. This is an early-stage open-source project aimed at building a flexible and customizable plugin to extend the functionality of WordPress websites.

Project Status: Early Development
The plugin is currently in the early stages of development. Our goal is to create a robust, extensible solution that allows WordPress site owners and developers to easily integrate custom features into their sites. Weâ€™re working on core functionality and plan to add features in future releases.

Planned Features
Custom Post Types: For managing new content types beyond standard posts and pages.
Shortcodes: Aiming to simplify dynamic content embedding.
Widgets: Adding custom widgets for sidebars, footers, and other areas.
API Integrations: Enabling seamless connections with third-party services.
Getting Started
Installation (In Progress)
Instructions for installation and setup will be provided once the core features are ready for testing.
