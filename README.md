Custom WordPress Plugin (In Development)
<br>
Welcome to the repository for the Custom WordPress Plugin. This is an early-stage open-source project aimed at building a flexible and customizable plugin to extend the functionality of WordPress websites.

Project Status: Early Development
The plugin is currently in the early stages of development. Our goal is to create a robust, extensible solution that allows WordPress site owners and developers to easily integrate custom features into their sites. We’re working on core functionality and plan to add features in future releases.

Planned Features
Custom Post Types: For managing new content types beyond standard posts and pages.
Shortcodes: Aiming to simplify dynamic content embedding.
Widgets: Adding custom widgets for sidebars, footers, and other areas.
API Integrations: Enabling seamless connections with third-party services.
